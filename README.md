# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

This is a **command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game** implemented in Python for two players. The game allows users to play in turns, with one player using **'X'** and the other using **'O'**. The goal is to align three symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal to win.

## How to Play
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to enter a position (1-9) on the grid where they want to place their symbol.
3. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a **horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line** wins the game.
4. If all 9 cells are filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game ends in a **tie**.

### Grid Mapping:
1	| 2	| 3 <br>
4	| 5	| 6 <br>
7	| 8	| 9 <br>
